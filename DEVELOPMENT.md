# Development

## Prerequisites

Packages and software required to develop the tool.

Required:

- Direnv
- Poetry
- Postgres
- Redis
- Yarn

Optional / Recommended

- Virtualenvwrapper
- Watchexec
- Heroku-cli
- Direnv

## Setup

After installing virtualenvwrapper, create an environment:

```bash
mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages gyana -p python3
```

Install all required python and node dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
yarn install
```

On MacOS you may run into a bug with `psycopg2` due to an outdated package `django-heroku`, after
the install fails the first time run and run `poetry install` again. For more details on this see:
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26288042/error-installing-psycopg2-library-not-found-for-lssl>

```bash
env LDFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib" pip install psycopg2
```

Create a local database and run migrations on it:

```bash
createdb gyana
python manage.py migrate
```

Make sure to authenticate using gcloud and generate the relevant env variables:

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project gyana-1511894275181
just env
```

Next create a bigquery dataset. We use the git config email as slug to effectively namespace dev environments from eachother in the cloud.

```bash
just mk_bq
```

You now need to run webpack to bundle all the client side code and styles:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can also run `yarn build:watch` to watch for file changes.

At this point you should be able to run the app, make sure that postgresql is running (and redis-server if running celery).

```bash
just dev
just dev-celery # Optional
```

## Develop

Commands:

- `just dev`
- `just dev-celery`
- `yarn build:watch`

Create a new CRUDL Django app with `just startapp`.

## Testing with Cypress

Setup your test app:

- `createdb cypress_gyana`
- `just cypress-setup`

Run cypress + app with hot-reloading:

- `just cypress-server`
- `just cypress-celery`
- `yarn build:watch`
- `yarn cypress:open`

The app is seeded with the fixtures defined in `cypress/fixtures/fixtures.json`. To modify the fixtures:

- Reset the database `just celery-setup`
- Go to the app in the browser and modify it
- Dump the fixtures `just celery-fixtures`
- Manually the fixtures file to format with prettier (better diff)
- Commit

## Deployment

For more in-depth information see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)

Run `just export` and push to main. View errors on
[Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/gyana-mvp).

## Adding new data science nodes

To add new nodes, you need to add the new node kind to the model choices and the required fields as new columns. The current naming convention for these columns is `<kind>_property`. You can then add a form object to the `KIND_TO_FORM` map in _workflows/forms.py_. Inheriting from `ModelForm` is the easiest way to implement these forms.

To display the nodes data and add to the flows SQL query add a function `NODE_FROM_CONFIG` in _workflows/nodes.py_.
