      "body": "<p data-block-key=\"rr33r\">Happy holidays everyone.</p><p data-block-key=\"9qq36\">If you’re reading this, chances are you helped us in some way this year. So … thank you. It means a lot, to all of us.</p><p data-block-key=\"3hnl2\"><b>2021 was a good year for Gyana.</b> We launched <a href=\"https://www.gyana.com/blog/the-next-chapter-of-gyana\"><b>Gyana 2.0</b></a>, built our fantastic <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/891928461364849\"><b>community</b></a> and helped thousands of customers discover new ways to <a href=\"https://www.gyana.com/blog/learnings-from-one-week-with-gyana\"><b>work with data</b></a>.</p><p data-block-key=\"bh7n0\">Today, businesses who want be data-driven have only two options: spend $100k and hire a team of data engineers, or build a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine\"><b>Rube-Goldberg machine</b></a> of connectors, zaps, spreadsheets and dashboards. As you told us, in over a thousand chats and video calls.</p><p data-block-key=\"883uq\">2021 is the year we proved, definitely, a third way is possible - the power of a custom data platform but with a no-code interface, for less than your Zoom subscription.</p><p data-block-key=\"b2s17\">It took us a while to get here, but we’ve finally built something we’re really proud of. And we’re seeing the impact with our users, who have synced a total of <b>367,780,394 rows of data</b> into Gyana.</p><p data-block-key=\"7jvio\">Although on that note, I’m not sure about that word “users”…</p><h3 data-block-key=\"fc48q\"><b>For the builders...</b></h3><p data-block-key=\"2fqkj\">My number one learning in 2021 is about the appetite to build.</p><p data-block-key=\"2glm2\">Gyana is not a community of “users”, it’s a community of “builders”. Right now, you get a blank slate, a handful of tutorials, and it’s up to you to create. And you’ve exceeded our expectations, and then some.</p><p data-block-key=\"c9qbd\">Kudos to the person who built a workflow with a record <b>78 nodes</b>. It’s a thing of beauty. Really, it belongs in the Tate. You’ll never be truly appreciated, but we know what you did.</p><p data-block-key=\"72uhd\">As builders ourselves, we understand the risk you take when committing to a platform like Gyana. Thank you for trusting us. <b>It’s a privilege to watch you unleash your creativity.</b> You keep being awesome, and we’ll do our best to get out of your way.</p><h3 data-block-key=\"tihn\"><b>What next for 2022?</b></h3><p data-block-key=\"eu7mv\">For 2021, we challenged ourselves to take the fundamentals of an enterprise data stack (ETL, modelling, analytics , BI, orchestration, IAM, …) and wrap it into a <b>single no-code web app that one person can manage</b>.</p><p data-block-key=\"2gh1l\">In 2022, we plan to build on that foundation. Our guiding principle: whatever the data source, analysis workflow, or dashboard - <b>you can build it in Gyana</b>. Keep an eye out for hundreds of new connectors, custom APIs and dashboards themes.</p><p data-block-key=\"616ct\">On top of that, we’ll be introducing new features to build towards our goal of the complete data platform. <b>Actions</b> enable you to use your data results to do things - like export a Google Sheet or send emails. <b>Predictions</b> will help you understand trends and forecast results using machine learning. And our <b>developer platform</b> will enable you to build your own data analytics application on Gyana - in days, not months.</p><p data-block-key=\"2c6rc\">Finally, we’re going to put a <i>big</i> focus on learning and educational content. Video tutorials, pre-built templates, blog posts, walkthroughs, and a complete revamp of the website … <b>we know how important it is and it’s coming</b>.</p><p data-block-key=\"ao49t\">Have a wonderful break!</p><p data-block-key=\"2p1ll\">❤️ David + the Gyana team</p>",
