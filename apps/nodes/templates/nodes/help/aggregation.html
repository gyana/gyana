    Aggregations are useful to generate statistics for groups in your data.
    Select the <strong>columns</strong> you want to group by, the table is grouped in order of selection.
    Then choose the columns you want to aggregate on and the appropriate aggregation function. 
    If you don't select an aggregation, we add a column showing the count of the groups.
    If you don't select a group, the aggregation will be performed over the whole data.
