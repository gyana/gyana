testimonial:
  quote: As an <b>online marketing freelancer</b>, I have tried and tested many reporting tools such as DigiXport and Portometrics, but the issues I kept facing were data limitation and <b>restrictions on how I can display my data</b>. Gyana allows me to pull in <b>all the data I need</b> and the workflow stage let’s me create <b>the exact metrics that I require</b>.
