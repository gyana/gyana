faqs:
  - q: What is a row of data?
    a: Every integration you connect to Gyana (like a file, Google Sheet or Facebook
      account) is made up of one or more tables (think a Spreadsheet, but bigger). The
      tables are made up of rows - so for example, if your table is a list of your
      customers, each row is a customer. With Gyana you only pay for the integration
      storage - any intermediate results you create are free.
  - q: Are the integrations live?
    a: Yes - we pull the latest data from your data sources. You'll always be looking
      at the freshest insights, without any extra work.
  - q: Where is my data stored?
    a: Your data is stored securely by our cloud technology partners, and is encrypted
      at rest. Gyana is ISO 27001 certified, the gold standard for information
      security. Reach out to us if you'd like to learn more.
  - q: What about GDPR?
    a: Gyana is committed to GDPR compliance. Your data is always located in the UK and
      EU, and we act as your data processing partner.
