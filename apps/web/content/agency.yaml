testimonial:
  quote: As an online marketing freelancer, I have tried and tested many reporting tools such as DigiXport and Portometrics, but the issues I kept facing were data limitation and restrictions on how I can display my data. Gyana allows me to pull in all the data I need, and the workflow stage letâ€™s me create the exact metrics that I require.
