        We believe everyone, no matter their technical skills, should have the
        ability to better understand the reality around them. There are insights
        buried deep in your data, but it‚Äôs not obvious how to reach them unless
        you are a data analyst. That's why we built Gyana: an analytics tool
        that helps anyone explore and discover trends hidden in their data by
        asking questions they know they want answered.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe that data should be democratized. Data can seem daunting, but
        it doesn't have to be! That's why we set out to make the path to insight
        as simple and intuitive as possible with powerful tools like GYANA.
      </p>

      <p>
        We're a software company that helps non-technical knowledge workers and
        business professionals do technical things with ease. We build tools to
        help you use technology without having to be an expert on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Data analytics is hard. Cleaning data, analyzing it and reporting on it
        takes time and resources that most people don't have. We make data
        science accessible to everyone with our intelligent automated software
        tools so you can focus on the business insights you need to drive your
        company forward.
      </p>

      <p>
        Big data and artificial intelligence are complex. It takes a lot of work
        to make sense of them. We've removed the barrier of entry so you can
        uncover the insights your data holds and unleash your potential as a
        citizen data analyst with Gyana.
