          Only 0.4% of the world can code. The rest of us struggle against the
          limitations of traditional reporting tools, or wait for weeks on the engineering
          team. It's frustrating and stops real work happening.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-600">
          <strong>That's why we built Gyana.</strong> Gyana is designed for making

          for any<sup class="text-indigo-600 text-caveat text-xl">2</sup> data source,

          You get the flexibility of code, with the usability of traditional reporting.
          Whatever report you want to build, you can build it with Gyana, without waiting on someone else.
