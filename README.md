Gyana is a toolkit for building business intelligence tools, written in Django.

Why Gyana? In our experience, traditional BI tools lack the flexibility most businesses need, but building a modern data stack is often overkill.

Gyana solves this in two ways:

1. A set of no-code abstractions that provide close to the flexibility of code solutions (but without associated headaches)
2. An extensible, open source codebase where it's easy to add custom business logic (think: formulas, nodes or entire features) in idiomatic Django

Using Gyana, you can deliver a data analytics experience tailored to your needs of your business, stakeholders or clients, without wasting time in repetitive coding tasks.

## Features

- Modern data stack "in a box" - no-code interface for ELT, writing SQL, building dashboards and automating pipelines
- Fully-featured collaboration system for internal teams or managing clients
- Opinionated, high quality, low Javascript (think: HTMX + AlpineJS) codebase built on idiomatic Django
- Fully open source, self-host wherever you want

## Getting started

You can run Gyana locally <5 mins with docker:

git clone git@github.com:gyana/gyana.git
